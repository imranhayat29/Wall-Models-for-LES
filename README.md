# Wall-Models-for-LES
MATLAB codes for the following wall models for LES are contained in this repository: 

1) Traditional ODE equilibrium WM  
2) Spectral ODE equilibrium WM 
3) Integral WM  

Channel flow DNS data from Johns Hopkins Turbulence Database (JHTDB) and UT-Austin database are used for apriori validation of these three wall models.
 
 
 NOTE: ArXiv link to the paper describing these wall models will be posted below soon. Please check back later.
